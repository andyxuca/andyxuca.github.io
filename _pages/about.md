Hi! I'm Andy, a student at Dartmouth College studying computer science. My research interests revolve around applications of AI/ML across subjects ranging from natural language processing to music. In my free time, I enjoy exploring the outdoors, playing instruments, practicing with the Dartmouth Triathlon Team, and watching Game of Thrones.
