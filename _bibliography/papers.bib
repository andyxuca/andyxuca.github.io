  abstract={In order to have a more immersive auditory virtual reality experience, a method to better reproduce a sense of distance is required. We recorded sounds at varying distances to observe changes in the intensity and spectral content of moving sounds. By obtaining data from spectrograms, applying different filters, and implementing sound synthesis techniques in the time domain, we created a system that virtually emulates how we perceive those changes. We were able to simulate a sense of distance with synthesized sounds.},
